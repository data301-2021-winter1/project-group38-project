## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

- Max: I have always been a huge fan of hockey and sports analytics. I believe that sports and how they work can be boiled down to numbers and analysis. Of course like anyone who enjoys sports, I have always 
wondered how I would stand up in a professional league. Of course my skills are no where near the players, however if it was strictly based on something like size, ex: height and weight, how would I do in the league? This is directly related to my research question. I want to use the data at hand to determine the ideal size for performing different roles in the NHL. What is the best height and weight for goal scoring, goaltending, faceoff percentage, blocked shots on defence? These are all super interesting questions that could be derived from analyzing our dataset and allow people to compare themselves to these statistics and see how they would do!
