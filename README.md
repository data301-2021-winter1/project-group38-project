## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

- Max: I have always been a huge fan of hockey and sports analytics. I believe that sports and how they work can be boiled down to numbers and analysis. Of course like anyone who enjoys sports, I have always wondered how I would stand up in a professional league. Of course my skills are no where near the players, however if it was strictly based on something like size, ex: height and weight, how would I do in the league? This is directly related to my research question. I want to use the data at hand to determine the ideal size for performing different roles in the NHL. What is the best height and weight for goal scoring, goaltending, faceoff percentage, blocked shots on defence? These are all super interesting questions that could be derived from analyzing our dataset and allow people to compare themselves to these statistics and see how they would do!
- Matt: I have played sports for my whole life. Now I watch sports all the time, and hockey is one that I pay the most attention to. In the past I have manually kept track of player statistics and analyze them myself. Now that I have the opportunity, I am excited to use real data analysis methods to look into sports stastitics. In the last few years, I have participated in many fantasy hockey leagues. My research question is connected to my interest in fantasy hockey. It is important to determine which players are going to significantly improve each year. This is why I will be using our dataset to analyze the careers of NHL all stars. By analyzing our dataset, I should be able to find key predictors that highlight players that will significantly improve. Our dataset has a wide array of statistics on every player that I will utilize to answer my question.
- Nihad: As a big sports fan, I have always been interested in the success of athletes in competitions and the statistics they demonstrate in games. To do this, I wanted to link my research question to the players in the NHL and their performance. Players in the league must show excellent accuracy in games. However, some of the players are less productive, or vice versa. In this analysis, I tried to compare the productivity of players based on some factors. And also, I analysed how many players play in different positions, and how their weights and heights differ.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset breaks down the statistics of any given player in each year that they played in the NHL. The dataset covers on-ice statistics such as goals, assists, and shooting statistics. In addition, it includes personal information on each player. You can find the players age, experience, and place of birth. Finally, it has information on the players height and weight. The most recent update was one year ago. The data covers information ranging between 1980 and 2020. For a more relevant analysis we will focus on 2000 onwards.This dataset was created for public interest with an extremely open ended set of data. The data can be further edited for transparency and to answer different research questions regarding the NHL and its players. Overall the data was created for fun use and public interest. The dataset was created by a Kaggle user named "BenZik". How the data was obtained is not specified. From the evidence at hand it appears the creator of the dataset, BenZik, supplied the data from another source which is not specified.
